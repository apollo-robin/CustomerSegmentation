Our engineering and manufacturing tradition of excellence means you can depend on the performance and reliability of our products. Our Tempra models are whole house tankless electric water heaters, never wasting energy storing hot water, but delivering it as you need it, for as long as you need it. The compact design needs no venting, allowing installation close to your draw off points, making your wait for hot water as short as possible and maximizing your energy savings. Tempra tankless water heaters are sized based on the number of bathrooms and your climate. Refer to the Tempra Sizing Guide under 'More Views' to determine which model you need. Call Stiebel Eltron at 800.582.8423 if you have high flow showers, or any sizing questions. Tempra water heaters supply water at a constant temperature from 86 to 140 degrees F that is settable on the front panel. We recommend setting the actual highest temperature you use, typically 107 degrees for a shower. Tempra Plus models incorporate an Advanced Flow Control that automatically reduces flow to deliver water at the set point if demand exceeds capacity. Regular Tempra models do not have this feature and should be considered if this is not of concern. Tempra 20 models provide hot water for 1 or 2 bathrooms in warm climates, or 1 bathroom in cool climates.Professional installation recommendedTempra 20 models require 208 or 240 volt electric service, with a maximum draw of 14,400 watts at 208 volts or 19,200 watts at 240 voltsA minimum of 200 amp total service to the residence is necessary, with 2 separate 50 amp breakers and 8 gauge copper wiring for the Tempra 20Tempra tankless electric water heaters are 99% efficient and typically result in savings of 15-20% in comparison with electric tank-type water heatersTempras use only the amount of energy necessary to heat the water neededThe sleek European design is considerably smaller than a tank, saving space and allowing flexibility to determine the best location for installationTempra units must be installed vertically with the water fittings pointing downTempra tankless water heaters work better than tank-type water heaters in hard water environments because they can be set to lower temperatures, which minimizes scale formationWater connections for Tempra water heaters must be detachable (such as braided steel flex connectors) to allow periodic filter cleaning, including flushing for scale if hard water is presentTempra tankless water heaters are ETL Listed for compliance with CSA and UL safety standards in the US and CanadaTempra tankless electric water heaters are exempt from seismic codeOverheat safety protection and thermal protection reset are standardSee warranty for complete details of the 3-year residential and commercial warranty against defects in workmanship and materials under normal useThis is a Tempra Plus model that incorporates an Advanced Flow Control to automatically reduce flow to deliver water at the set point if demand exceeds capacityStiebel Tempra Sizing Guide:"},{"Row ID":8651,"Order ID":"US-2014-161424","Order Date":"11-11-2014","Ship Date":"15-11-2014","Ship Mode":"Standard Class","Customer ID":"PJ-18835","Customer Name":"Patrick Jones","Segment":"Corporate","City":"Santo Domingo","State":"Santo Domingo","Country":"Dominican Republic","Postal Code":"","Market":"LATAM","Region":"Caribbean","Product ID":"FUR-FU-10000743","Category":"Furniture","Sub-Category":"Furnishings","Product Name":"Eldon Frame, Erganomic","Sales":268.03,"Quantity":7,"Discount":0.5,"Profit":-230.51,"Shipping Cost":43.13,"Order Priority":"High","rating":1,"Product Description":"Diva from Lutron is a simple and elegant solution designed to match your existing designer opening switches and accessories.

Fire is a deadly threat to every household; it can strike anywhere, any time. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in America, yet many people don't know they are suffering from CO poisoning until its too late. Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are like the flu, and you might not even know you're in danger at first. This dual smoke and carbon monoxide alarm is an excellent way to protect your family. The SCO5CN uses an electrochemical carbon monoxide sensor, the most accurate technology available. The alarm uses photoelectric smoke sensing technology which reduces nuisance alarms, making it ideal for cooking areas. Photoelectric smoke alarms are great for sensing slow smoldering fires quickly. The test/silence button both silences a non-threatening alarm or low battery warning and allows you to test the unit's functionality. The SCO5CN alarm uses different 85-decibel horns and lights depending on whether it's alerting you to smoke or carbon monoxide. A low battery signal alerts you to replace the battery and end-of-life alarm of three chirps alerts you to replace the unit. Two AA batteries are included. 7-year limited warranty.

Simply remove rugged mesh, vacuum up the fine silt and open your pool. Rugged mesh's fine mesh allows rain and snow to slowly fill your pool, saving water and chemicals in the spring. Since our scrim is so tightly woven, the cover allows almost no sunlight through and ensures an algae-free pool in the spring. Blue Wave mesh covers are made from tough U V protected woven polyethylene that is strong enough to handle ice, snow, sleet and high winds. Rugged double stitched hems are triple reinforced for strength and the cover's black underside retards algae growth.
